All numbers are in hex
9 = OPCODE For Input / Output
1 = OPERAND for Input 

91 = Input
31 = Save Accumulator Value to Ram 01
91 = Input (Accumulator is overwritten)
30 = Save Accumulator Value to Ram 00
91 = Input (Accumulator is overwritten)
32 = Save Accumulator to Ram 02
52 = Load Ram 02 into the Acculumlator
79 = Branch into Ram 09 if the Acculumlator == 0
8d =  Branch into Ram 0d if the Acculumlator > 0
51 = Load into Acculumlator Ram 01
20 = Subtract Acculumlator from Ram 0
92 = Ouput Acculumlator
00 = HALT program
51 = Load into Acculumlator Ram 01
10 = Add Acculumlator from Ram 0
92 = Output Acculumlator
As All Ram cells are used and there isnt any branching it treats it as 00 (halt)
